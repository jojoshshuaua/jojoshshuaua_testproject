<h1>Intensity</h1>

<p>The y-axis of the output graph (the graph on the lower half of the screen) and the tandem output graph (the graph on the upper half of the screen) represents the intensity of the peptide fragments.</p>

<p>Intensity is calculated relative to the most abundant peak. If there is a specific pattern of residues in the analyzed protein’s peptide sequence that occurs more than once, the fragment(s) that pattern of residues creates will be more abundant than fragments from patterns that occur only once.</p>

<p>The most abundant type of peptide fragment is given an intensity of 100. If a different type of peptide fragment occurs three-quarters as often, it is given an intensity of 75. If a still different type of peptide fragment occurs half as often as the most abundant type, it is given an intensity of 50, and so on and so forth.</p>
