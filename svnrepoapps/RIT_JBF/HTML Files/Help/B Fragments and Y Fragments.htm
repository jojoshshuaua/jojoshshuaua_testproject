<h1>B Fragments and Y Fragments</h1>

<p>After performing a tandem mass spectrometry the graph on the upper half of the screen will display at least two colored lines, or peaks. The blue peak(s) represent the b-fragments and the red peak(s) represent the y-fragments.</p>

<p>When a large number of a specific type of protein is digested by a protease, several types of smaller peptide fragments are left over. It is these smaller peptide fragments that show up as lines, or peaks, on the graph on the lower half of the screen. The ‘tandem’ in tandem mass spectrometry comes in to play here; by clicking on one of the peaks on the lower graph, the type of peptide fragments it represents is broken down at specific points along the peptide backbone. For each CO-NH bond along the peptide backbone, two fragments (one b and one y) will be created by a single such bond being broken. If the resulting positive charge ends up on the CO side of the bond, the new fragment is called a b-fragment. If the resulting positive charge ends up on the NH side of the bond, the new fragment is called a y-fragment. The side of the bond that does not receive the positive charge remains uncharged, and so does not show up on the tandem output graph.</p>

<p>Because only one CO-NH bond is broken per fragment in the large amount of fragments the peak on the output graph represented, and the charged fragments will only differ in size by the mass of one residue compared to its neighbors, it is possible to use the mass difference between successive b-fragment peaks or y-fragment peaks to ‘read’ the residue sequence of the selected output graph peptide fragment. The b-fragments are read left to right, and the y-fragments are read right to left.</p>

<p>To change the tandem output graph’s display so only one type of fragment, b or y, is shown, toggle the B Fragment and Y Fragment check boxes.</p>
