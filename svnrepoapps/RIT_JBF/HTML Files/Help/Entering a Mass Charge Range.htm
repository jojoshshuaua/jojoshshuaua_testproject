<h1>Entering a Mass Charge Range</h1>

<p>The <img src="Images/Mass Charge Range.PNG" alt="Mass Charge Range Selection" /> mass charge range input boxes provide a way to control how expansive the output graph’s</p>

<p>and tandem output graph’s</p>

<p>m/e scales are. m/e stands for mass divided by charge, and arranges the peptide fragments digested by the selected protease by their weight over charge ratios. Because all fragments have a charge of +1 from the amino-terminal end, this is essentially a mass scale.</p>

<p>Peptide fragments possessing a mass/charge ratio outside of the range selected by the user will not have their peaks displayed on either graph. The m/e scale will change to reflect the user’s choice of range.</p>

<p>If a range possessing a lower limit higher than the upper limit or a negative number for either limit is entered the offending limit will be set to its default value; 0 for the lower limit, and 3000 for the upper limit. Non-number input will be corrected in the same way.</p>
