<h1>Selecting a Protease<o:p></h1>

<p>There are four proteases available to use to digest the peptide sequence entered in the protein sequence box.</p>

<p>Proteases are enzymes that cut apart a peptide sequence at specific points by recognizing a pattern of residues. Each protease recognizes a different pattern. After the sequence has been cut apart, or digested, by the protease it exists as numerous peptide fragments that the mass spectrometer will analyze the size and charge of.</p>

<p>The proteases to choose from are:</p>

<p><b>Trypsin</b>: will cut a peptide sequence after (C-terminal side) an Arginine(R) or Lysine(K), except when either is followed by a Proline(P).</p>

<p><b>Chymotrypsin</b>: cuts a peptide sequence after Tyrosin(Y), Tryptophan(W), or Phenylalanine(F).</p>

<p><img height=400 src="Images/Protease Effects II.png" alt="Protease Effects II"/></p>

<p><b>Proteinase K</b>: cuts a peptide sequence after Alanine(A), Phenylalanine(F), Isoleucine(I), Leucine(L), Valine(V), Tryptophan(W), or Tyrosine(Y).</p>

<p><img height=400 src="Images/Protease Effects III.png" alt="Protease Effects III"/></p>

<p><b>Thermolysin</b>: cuts before (N-terminal side) Isoleucine(I), Leucine(L), Methionine(M), or Valine(V).</p>
