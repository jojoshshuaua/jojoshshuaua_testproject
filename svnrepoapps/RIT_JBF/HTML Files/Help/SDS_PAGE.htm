<p>The simulation can be paused, stopped, or restarted using the Animation Buttons. Pushing the run button again after the simulation has automatically stopped will cause the gel to run for another period of time. Pushing the restart button will set the program back to the condition it was in when first started- with no protein files loaded.</p>
