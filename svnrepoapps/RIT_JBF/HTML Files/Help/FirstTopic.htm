<p>We have developed a 2D electrophoresis simulation and a tandem mass spectrometry simulation.</p>

<p>The 2D electrophoresis simulation can accept input in three different file formats: FASTA, Genbank, and Protein Data Bank. Individual protein spots in the final output are linked to data about that protein and to external databases. In addition to the on-screen simulation of the separation process, the application also generates output in the form of HTML and spreadsheet files that contain sequence, function, molecular weight and pI values.</p>

<p>The tandem mass spectrometry simulation can accept manual input, fasta file input, and input from the 2D electrophoresis
simulation. The simulation runs a mass spectrum of the inputted protein sequence and can run a second mass spectrum of individual peptide fragments.</p>
