<h1>Animation buttons</h1>

<p>There are three animation buttons used for running the electrophoresis gel; Run, Stop, and Restart. During an SDS-Page animation, the Run button will change to the Pause button.</p>

<p>The Run button will change to the Pause button when an SDS-Page animation is in progress; click it to freeze the gel in the condition it is in. If you wish to run the gel for a longer period of time after the animation has stopped, click the Run button again.</p>

<p>The Stop button will return the gel to the condition it was in before either the IEF or SDS-Page animations were run, but with the protein list(s) still loaded, along with any changes those lists may have undergone.</p>

<p>The Reset button will return all of the conditions of the gel back to what they were when the JBioFramework program was first opened. This includes unloading the protein lists and clearing the gel canvas.</p>
