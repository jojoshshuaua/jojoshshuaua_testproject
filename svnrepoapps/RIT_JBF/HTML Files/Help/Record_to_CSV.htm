<h1>Record to CSV</h1>

<p>Clicking on the Record to CSV Button will appear to do nothing. However, it is creating a comma separated file of the essential values of each protein in the currently loaded set and placing it in the CSV Files folder.</p>

<p>The file can be imported into spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel for further analysis. The file contains the titles of the proteins, their amino acid sequences, molecular weights, pI values, and X and Y coordinates on the 2-D gel.</p>
