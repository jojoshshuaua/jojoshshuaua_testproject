<h1>Finding the Mass of a Peptide Fragment</h1>

<p>To determine the exact mass of a peptide fragment after running a mass spectrum, click on the line, or peak, on the output graph (the graph on the lower half of the screen) to select the fragment that peak represents. A tandem mass spectrum will be run on the fragment, but the mass label on the lower left-hand side of the screen will also change to reflect the exact mass of the peptide fragment.</p>
