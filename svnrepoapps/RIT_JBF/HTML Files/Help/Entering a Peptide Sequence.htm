<h1>Entering a Peptide Sequence</h1>

<p>There are three ways to enter a peptide sequence for analysis by tandem mass spectroscopy.</p>

<p><b>1)</b> Type the sequence in the input protein sequence box:<img width=232 height=186 src="Images/InputPeptideSequence.PNG" alt="Peptide Sequence Box"/></p>

<p><b>2)</b> Load a sequence from a fasta file by clicking the ‘Load Sequence From File’ button and navigating to the file through the
directory.</p>

<p><b>3)</b> After running the <a href="SDS_PAGE.htm">SDS-Page</a> animation in the Electrophoresis 2D simulation, click on a protein dot that represents the protein to be analyzed, and in the Protein Information Frame, click on the ‘Run Mass Spectrum’ button. The peptide sequence for the protein will be put in the input protein sequence box in the Mass Spectrometer simulation.</p>
