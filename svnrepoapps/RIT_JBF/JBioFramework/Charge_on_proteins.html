<h2><a name="charge_on_proteins"></a>Charge on Proteins</h2>
<p>
The charge on proteins arises from some of the amino acid side 
chains, as well as the carboxy- and amino-termini, some prosthetic 
groups and bound ions.  This application is designed to calculate 
charge based only on the side chains and carboxy - and amino-termini.   </p>
<p>
The charge on amino acid side chains depends on the pH of the 
solution and the <nobr>pK<sub>A</sub></nobr> of the side chains.  It is also affected by 
the localized environment around a side chain.  We 
assume the following <nobr>pK<sub>A</sub></nobr> values for ionizable groups on the protein 
and that the side chains will have these <nobr>pK<sub>A</sub></nobr> values regardless of 
their environment within the protein.  We also assume 
that the separation is based on the total charge on the protein, 
not the mass-to-charge ratios.  Therefore, a protein with a charge 
of +15 will bind more tightly to a cation exchange stationary phase 
(CM-Sephadex, for example) than a protein with a charge of +10, 
regardless of size.</p>

<p>
The charge on these proteins can be calculated using the method 
described in <a href="Relationship_of_charge_to_pH.html">Relationship of Charge to pH</a>.  
In brief, when the pH is less than the <nobr>pK<sub>A</sub></nobr> of a 
group, the protonated 
form of the group predominates.  This leaves the acidic side chains with 
a charge approaching 0 and the basic side chains with a charge 
approaching a limiting value of +1.  Conversely, when the pH is 
greater than the <nobr>pK<sub>A</sub></nobr> of a group, the 
deprotonated form predominates, 
giving acidic side chains a charge approaching -1 and basic side 
chains a charge approaching 0.  </p>

<p>

The charge on the protein is the sum of the charges on the 
individual amino acid side chains.  However, the charge on individual 
amino acid side chains can vary when they are near a group of non-polar 
or highly charged side chains.  For example the normal <nobr>pK<sub>A</sub></nobr> for glutamic 
acid is about 4.3.  In lysozyme, two glutamic acid residues are in the 
active site.  One is in a polar environment and has a normal <nobr>pK<sub>A</sub></nobr> value.  
The other glutamate side chain is in a hydrophobic environment, where 
a negative charge is energetically unfavorable. Therefore the <nobr>pK<sub>A</sub></nobr> value 
for this glutamate side chain increases, which then decreases the extent 
of the deprotonation of that side chain.  This is very important in the 
mechanism of lysozyme, which requires that one of the side chains be 
charged (deprotonated) and the other be uncharged (protonated) at the 
same time.</p>
