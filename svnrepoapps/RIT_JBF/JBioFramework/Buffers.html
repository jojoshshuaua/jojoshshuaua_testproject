<p>
A buffer is a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base 
and its conjugate acid; such mixtures are effective in resisting change in 
pH when strong base or acid is added to a solution.  By definition a weak 
acid or a weak base is one that only slightly dissociates when dissolved 
in water.  Acetic acid is a weak acid whose behavior can be described by 
the following equilibrium expression and acid dissociation constant.</p>

<p>
If one mole of acetic acid is added to water with a final volume of 1 Liter, 
then only about 0.4% of the acid is dissociated.  If a strong base is added 
to a weak acid, the acid dissociates, releasing a proton <nobr>(H<sup>+</sup>)</nobr> to 
neutralize the base.  In this way, the weak acid decreases the change in pH 
that results from adding the base. </p>
<p>
If 0.010 moles of NaOH (a strong base) are added to pure water (final volume 
1 Liter), the pH of the solution will be 12.  On the other hand, if 0.010 
moles of NaOH are added to a solution of 0.010 M acetic acid (final volume 
1 Liter), the pH increases from 3.2 to 4.76, according to the 
<A href="H-H_equation.html">Henderson-Hasselbalch equation</a>.  </p>
<p>
To prepare a 0.010M sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.76, you need to add NaOH 
to a concentration of 0.010 M to a 0.010 M acetic acid solution.  This is 
normally done by adding 0.010 moles of acetic acid to 900 mL of water, then 
adding 0.010 moles of NaOH gradually while checking the pH with a pH meter.  
The solution is then brought to a final volume of 1 Liter in a volumetric 
flask.  It is important to check the pH with a calibrated meter because 
<nobr>pK<sub>A</sub></nobr> 

values for weak acids and bases vary with temperature and 
salt concentration, so the values predicted by 
the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation are only approximate.  Another way to 
prepare a 0.010 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.76, is to mix equal volumes of 
0.010 M acetic acid and 0.010 M sodium acetate.</p>
<p>
A plot of pH vs. equivalents of NaOH added to a solution of acetic acid 
shows that it is most effective in buffering when the pH is close to the 
<nobr>pK<sub>A</sub></nobr>. </p>

<p>
Although this application offers a choice of only three buffers, other 
buffers with a wide range of <nobr>pK<sub>A</sub></nobr> values are available to allow the 
preparation of effective buffers at almost any pH value.  In selecting a 
buffer, it is important to consider sensitivity to change in temperature, 
concentration and ionic strength, as these all may affect the <nobr>pK<sub>A</sub></nobr> 

for the buffer.</p>
