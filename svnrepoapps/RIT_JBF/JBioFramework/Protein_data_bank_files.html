<p>
A PDB file is a database that contains three dimensional coordinates 
for macromolecular structures such as proteins and nucleic acids.  
Each line in the database is a field and the first term in each field 
describes the information to follow.  A complete description of how to 
read a PDB file is available over the WWW at 
<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb//docs/format/pdbguide2.2/guide2.2_frame.html">http://www.rcsb.org/pdb//docs/format/pdbguide2.2/guide2.2_frame.html</a>.  
The most important fields for this application are the Name fields, 
the alpha carbon coordinates and the amino acid identification, which 
are used to calculate charge on a protein. </p>
