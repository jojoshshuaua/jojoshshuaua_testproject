<h2><a name="protein_structure"></a>Protein Structure</h2>
<p>
Proteins are linear polypeptide chains consisting of a series of 
<A href="Amino_Acids.htm">amino acids</A> connected by peptide bonds.  In 
addition to this covalent backbone, proteins are also held together by a 
variety of other covalent and non-covalent forces (see Levels of Protein 
Architecture).</p>
<p>

As a general rule, proteins exist in an aqueous environment.  As the protein 
is synthesized, it folds with charged or polar residues on the outside (facing 
the aqueous environment), while hydrophobic residues are usually found on the 
inside of a protein.</p>
