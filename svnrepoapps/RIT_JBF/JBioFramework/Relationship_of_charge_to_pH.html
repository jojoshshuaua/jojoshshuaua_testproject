<h2><a name="relationship"></a>Relationship of Charge to pH</h2>
<p>
pH is the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration in a 
solution.  Similarly <nobr>pK<sub>A</sub></nobr> is the negative log of the acid dissociation 
constant for an amino acid side chain.</p>

In solution, if pH &lt; <nobr>pK<sub>A</sub></nobr>, then 
the protonated form of an amino acid side chain predominates 
according to the <a href="H-H_equation.html">Henderson-Hasselbalch equation</a> . 
If pH &gt; <nobr>pK<sub>A</sub></nobr>, then the deprotonated 
form of the amino acid side chain predominates.   The charge on an 
acidic side chain can therefore vary between -1 (when pH &lt;&lt; 

<nobr>pK<sub>A</sub></nobr>) and 0 ( when pH &gt;&gt; <nobr>pK<sub>A</sub></nobr>).  
Consider the example of glutamate, with a side chain <nobr>pK<sub>A</sub></nobr> = 4.4.  
When the pH = <nobr>pK<sub>A</sub></nobr>, the concentration of the 
protonated and deprotonated forms is equal and the charge is -0.5.  
When pH = 6.4, the glutamate is about 99% deprotonated, leading 
to a charge of -0.99.  When pH = 2.4, the glutamate is about 99% 
protonated, leading to a charge of -0.01.</p>
<p>
The charge on a basic side chain can range between 0 (when pH &gt;&gt; 

<nobr>pK<sub>A</sub></nobr>) and +1 (when pH &lt;&lt; <nobr>pK<sub>A</sub></nobr>).  
The side chain on lysine normally has a <nobr>pK<sub>A</sub></nobr> value of about 9.0.  
When pH = <nobr>pK<sub>A</sub></nobr>, the concentration of the 
protonated and deprotonated forms is equal and the charge is +0.5.  
When pH = 11.0, the lysine is about 99% deprotonated, leading to a charge 
of +0.01.  When pH = 7.0, the lysine is about 99% protonated, leading to a 
charge of +0.99.</p>
<p>
The graph below shows the relationship between charge and pH for the 
side chains of glutamate, an acidic amino acid, and lysine, a 
basic amino acid, assuming that these amino acids are incorporated 
in a protein and that they have <nobr>pK<sub>A</sub></nobr> values 
of 4.4 for glutamate and 10.0 for lysine.</p>
