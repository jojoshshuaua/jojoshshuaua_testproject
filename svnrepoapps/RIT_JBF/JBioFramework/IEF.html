<p class="title"><strong>Isoelectric points</strong></p>
      <p>Differences in proteins isoelectric points are the basis of separations 
        by isoelectric focusing (IEF). The pI is the pH at which a protein will 
        not migrate in an electric field and is determined by the charged groups 
        in the protein. Proteins can carry positive, negative or zero charge depending 
        on their local pH, and for every protein there is a specific pH at which 
        its net charge is zero; this is its pI. pI's generally fall in the range 
        3 - 12, with most being around 4 - 7.</p>

      <p>When a protein is placed in a medium with a pH gradient and subjected 
        to an electric field it will initially move towards the electrode with 
        the opposite charge. During migration through the pH gradient the protein 
        will pick up or lose protons. As it migrates the net charge and the mobility 
        will decrease and the protein will slow down. Eventually the protein will 
        arrive at the point in the pH gradient which is equal to its pI. Here 
        it will be uncharged and hence stop migrating. If the protein should happen 
        to diffuse to a region outside its pI it will pick up a charge and hence 
        move back to the position where it is neutral. In this way proteins are 
        condensed, or focused, into sharp bands.</p>
      <p><strong>pH gradients</strong></p>
      <p>pH gradients are established by using carrier ampholytes. These are molecules 
        which are engineered to have a particular pK. By mixing them it is possible 
        to form a mixture which will establish a pH gradient. Originally these 
        molecules were cast into the gel and an electric field applied to form 
        the pH gradient. This was an efficient method but suffered because the 
        ampholytes would drift during the isoelectric focusing step. It is also 
        extremely difficult to reproduce gradients in these systems.</p>
      <p>Nowadays immobilized pH gradients (IPG's) are used. The carrier ampholytes 
        are attached to acrylamide molecules and cast into the gels to form a 
        pH gradient that is fixed. This prevents drift in the gel and also ensures 
        that they can be cast in an efficient and reproducible manner.</p>
