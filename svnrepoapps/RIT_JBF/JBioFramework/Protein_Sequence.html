<p>
Proteins are polymers of amino acids that are synthesized in the cell.  Proteins 
perform a variety of functions in nature.  Proteins that catalyze chemical reactions 
are called enzymes.  Examples of enzymes are trypsin, which digests proteins in the 
food you eat and thrombin, which is involved in blood clot formation.  Proteins are 
also components of receptors on cell surfaces that bind hormone molecules from the 
blood stream, resulting in changes in cell behavior.  Proteins are important in our 
defense mechanism as antibodies that recognize and bind to foreign materials that enter 
our systems.  The structural proteins actin and myosin form muscles and are involved 
in contractile processes of motion, heartbeat, and breathing.  Proteins are also found 
in our cell membranes and in the coat of viruses.</p>

Many protein structures have been determined and are available on the World Wide 
Web (WWW) at the Protein Data Bank 
<a href="http://www.rcsb.org">http://www.rcsb.org.</a>.  The three dimensional 
structures of these proteins can be studied in depth using a free visualization tool 
called Rasmol which is also available at no charge on the WWW
