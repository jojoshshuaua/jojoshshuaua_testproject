<A NAME="starting">
<u><b>Starting The Application:</b></u>
   <p>From the command line change directories into the location where this
   application is stored on your computer.  Change directories into the <i>
   source code</i> directory.  Type the command <i>java Electro2D</i> and 
   press enter and the application should start. </p>
</HR>
<A NAME="loadingfile">
<u><b>Loading a File:</b></u>
   <p>One the main screen click the <i>Add Proteins</i> button.  To view a 
   list of available files in your directory click the red text in the 
   instructions at the top of the new window that opened.  Copy the file name
   and paste it into the text field labeled "Enter Filename:".  Be sure to 
   include the extention as well.  If the file is not located in your directory
    (the "data" folder), copy and paste the entire contents of the file into
   the large text area below the "Enter Filename:" field.  Be sure to enter 
   the file name and extention of this file as well.  Once this is complete,
   click the "Load File" button.</p>
   <b>Note:</b> Larger files may take a long time to load (ex. approx. 1 
   minute).  Please be patient. </BR>
   <b>Troubleshooting:</b>
   <p> If you receive an error message saying, "Invalid Extention," please 
   double-check that the file extention is one of the following: 
    .e2d, .gbk, .faa, .fasta, .pdb</BR>
   If it is not one of these file types, the application will be unable to 
   recognize it.</p><br>
   <p>If you receive an "Error reading from file," error message, double-check
   that the file name you entered is in your "data" directory.  If it is not,
    but located on your computer, move the file to the "data" directory and 
   try again.  If the file is not located on your machine, in addition to 
   entering the file name, be sure to copy and paste the entire contents of the
    file into the large text area provided.</p>
   </HR>
<A NAME="preprocessed">
<u><b>About Preprocessed Files (.e2d files):</b></u>
   <p>Proteome files often take a significantly long time to load.  In order 
   to prevent this wait from occurring each time you load a proteome file, 
   the application generates a file containing all information relevant to the
    program's performance.  This file may be loaded in place of the original 
   proteome file in future runs of the program.  </p>
   <p>The files are given the extention ".e2d" and are stored in your data 
   folder.  If you load a file named "pseudomonas_putida.gbk" the program will
   then create a file named "pseudomonas_putida_gbk.e2d" for you to use in the
   future as opposed to the entire genBank file.  All information that is 
   stored in this file will be in the same format as it was in the original
   genBank file.</p>
   </HR>
<A NAME="comparing">
<u><b> Comparing the Contents of Two Proteome Files: </u></b>
   <p>In order to compare two proteome files, load in one proteome file and 
   once this is complete click on the <i>Compare Proteins</i> button and follow
   the same directions for loading a file in the screen that appears.</p>
   <p>When you play the animation, the proteins will appear in three different 
   colors: red, yellow, and green.  The green proteins are those whose 
   amino acid sequences appear in both proteome files.  If the protein is red
   it appeared only in the first file loaded, and if it is yellow it was only 
   in the second file.</p>
   </HR>
<A NAME="selectanimation">
<u><b>Selecting a Portion of the Animation to be Played</u></b>
   <p>To select a portion of the animation to be played, make a selection in 
   the <i>Animation Select</i> box.  If you have not yet run the IEF 
   animation, selecting the SDS-PAGE portion of the animation will not 
   do anything when you go to run the animation.</p>
</HR>
<A NAME="playing">
<u><b>Starting the Animation</u></b>
   <p>In order to start the animation click on the play button under animation
    controls.  The play button is the one that has a single triangle on it 
   pointing to the right.</p>
   <p><b>Troubleshooting:</b> If the program is not playing when you click the 
   play button, there may be several things that need to be done.  First, be 
   sure you have <a href = "./help.html#loadingfile">loaded a file</a> in the 
   application. Next, if you have not run the Isoelectric Focusing portion of 
   the animation, be sure that the <i>Animation Select</i> option is on 
   "IEF".</p>
   </HR>
<A NAME="stoppause">
<u><b>Stopping/Pausing the Animation</u></b>
   <p>The animation will automatically pause after ten seconds of play.  
   However, if you wish to stop the animation while it is running you can 
   either reclick the <a href ="./help.html#playing">play</a> button which 
   will now appear as two rectangles, or click on the stop button.  The stop 
   button has a single square on it and is located under <i>Animation 
   Controls</i>.  You can then click the play button to continue the animation,
    or press the <a href="./help.html#restart">restart</a> button to restart 
   the animation.</p>
</HR>
<A NAME="restart">
<u><b>Restarting the Animation</u><b>
   <p>To restart the animation, click the restart button that is located under 
   <i>Animation Controls</i>.  The restart button has a triangle that is 
   pointing upward and is above a rectangle.</p>
</HR>
<A NAME="removeprotein">
<u><b>Removing a Single Protein from the Animation</u></b>
   <p>To remove a protein or multiple proteins from the list, simply click on 
   their titles in the list of proteins then click the <i>Remove Proteins</i> 
   button.  This will remove the proteins from memory and they will not appear
    in the next run of the animation.  This must be done before you run the 
   animation (ie. immediately after loading the file or after pressing the 
   restart button).  Once the animation is drawn to the screen doing this 
   will do nothing.</p>
</HR>
<A NAME="acrylamide">
<u><b>Adjusting the % Acrylamide Level</u></b>
   <p>To adjust the percent acrylamide of the gel, click on the <i>% 
   Acrylamide </i>choice box and select the percentage desired.  This should 
   be done before running the animation.  Both fixed and gradient gels are 
   offered.</p>
</HR>
<A NAME="pI">
<u><b>Adjusting the pI Range</u></b>
   <p>In order to adjust the pI make a selection under the <i>Range Select</i>
    menu.  If you select "Enter a Range", the text boxes to the right of the
     menu should become operable.  Just enter the maximum and minimum values 
   you want represented, and you are all set.</p>
</HR>
<A NAME="infoList">
<u><b>View Information on a Protein from the List</u></b>
   <p>To view a protein's information from the contents list, double click on 
   any of the titles.  A window should open up displaying the title, pI, 
   molecular weight, and function, as well as links to web pages with more 
   information.  In addition to this, if you have already run and stopped the 
   animation, lines will appear to pinpoint the location of this individual 
   protein in the image.</p>
</HR>
<A NAME="infoImage">
<u><b>View Information on a Protein from the Image</u></b>
   <p>To view a protein's information from the animation image, just click on 
   the individual dot that represents the protein you are interested in.  An 
   information window should appear displaying the protein title, pI, molecular
    weight, and funciton, as well as links to web pages with more information.
    </p>
</HR>
<A NAME="csv">
<u><b>Record to a Comma Separated Value File</u></b>
   <p>Comma Separated Value files (CSV) are files that contain lines of 
   information whose values are separated by commas.  These files are able to 
   be opened in spreadsheet programs.  This simulator generates CSV files 
   containing protein titles, sequences, molecular weight, and pI values, as 
   well as the X and Y coordinates of each individual protein in the gel.  To 
   generate a CSV file for your animation result, click on the <i>Record to 
   CSV</i> button.  A CSV file with the same name as the proteome file that 
   was loaded in the application will be stored in the "CSV Files" directory.
