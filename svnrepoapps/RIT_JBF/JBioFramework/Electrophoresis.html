<h2><a name="Electrophoresis"></a>Electrophoresis</h2>
<p><strong>Separation based on size</strong></p>
      <p>Proteins are subsequently separated on the basis of their molecular mass 
        using sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). 
        Proteins resolved in the first dimension are applied to a second gel and 
        separated perpendicularly to the first dimension.</p>

      <p><strong>Detergents</strong></p>
      <p>Before the second separation proteins are treated with the detergent 
        sodium dodecyl sulphate. This coats all proteins in proportion to their 
        mass and ensures they all have a large negative charge. The proteins are 
        then applied to a gel matrix which sieves them on the basis of their size 
        when an electric current is applied. Upon electrophoresis proteins move 
        through the gel towards the anode. The rate at which they move is inversely 
        proportional to their molecular mass, larger proteins feeling more resistance 
        and hence taking longer to move.</p>
      <p>SDS is chosen because it binds to most proteins in a constant fashion 
        (about 1.4 grams of SDS per gram of protein) and also masks any charge 
        of the protein by forming these large anionic complexes. SDS also disrupts 
        any hydrogen bonds, blocks many hydrophobic interactions and partially 
        unfolds the protein molecules minimising differences based on secondary 
        or tertiary structure. A reducing agent such as beta-mercapthoethanol 
        or dithiothreitol is also often included in order to totally unfold proteins 
        and detach subunits to ensure a separation based exclusively on molecular 
        weight.</p>
      <p><strong>Different variations</strong></p>
      <p>There are many different methods of performing SDS-PAGE based on whether 
        analysis is required in a native or denatured state and the size of the 
        molecules being analysed. The most common method is that of Laemmli, while the method of Schagger and von Jagow is popular for polypeptides of 10 kDa or less.</p>

      <p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>
      <p>Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) is an extremely efficient process, 
        able to resolve many thousands of proteins, but it is does suffer from 
        a series of limitations.</p>
      <p>Proteins analysed by 2DE are not easily recoverable. It is possible to 
        remove them from the gel using electroblotting but this is a difficult 
        and imprecise technique. It is usually easier to digest the proteins within 
        the gel matrix using a protease enzyme such as trypsin.</p>
      <p>Analyses performed by gels are not particularly quantitative due to the 
        differing amounts proteins take up the staining reagents. Careful use 
        of calibrated standards does allow some quantification, but even this 
        is somewhat imprecise.</p>
      <p>2DE takes a long time to perform. Each of the individual stages requires 
        quite a long time to run, and much user intervention is required. This 
        makes 2DE an expensive technique in terms of worker hours.</p>
      <p>Proteins often react with the gel matrix. This leads to differing amounts 
        of acrylamide-protein polymers which makes identify proteins masses difficult. 
        The interactions also mean that mass spectrometry is complicated, especially 
        when combined with the fact that the proteins are hard to extract from 
        the gel.</p>

      <p>Performing 2DE is very much an art, requiring much experimentation to 
        find the correct conditions for sample preparation, focusing times etc. 
        If these are not optimised then artifacts can easily be introduced into 
        the 2D pattern.</p>
