<h2><a name="Sample_preparation"></a>Sample Preparation</h2>
<p>Sample preparation is often a key to successful two dimensional gel electrophoresis.
  Methods can range from simple solubilization into buffer to complex extractions 
        using chaotropic and reducing agents as well as detergents.</p>
      <p>An effective sample preparation method will:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Reproducible solubilize all proteins</li>
        <li>Prevent protein aggregation during focusing</li>
        <li>Prevent chemical modification of the protein</li>

        <li>Remove nucleic acids and other interfering molecules</li>
        <li>Yield proteins of interest at detectable levels, which may involve 
          the removal of abundant proteins or non-relevant classes</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Sample preparation is very much an art requiring much experimentation 
        before the correct conditions for a particular sample are found. Slight 
        variations in the concentrations of the solubilizing agents can have a 
        dramatic effect on the final appearance of the gels.</p>
      <p><strong>Solubilization</strong></p>
      <p>This is achieved by the use of <a href="#chaotropic" title="Description of chaotropic agents" class="body">chaotropic 
        agents</a> (such as urea), <a href="#detergents" title="Description of detergents" class="body">detergents</a> 
        (such as CHAPS), <a href="#reducing" title="Description of reducing agents" class="body"> 
        reducing agents</a> (such as dithiothreitol), buffers and ampholytes (the 
        charged species responsible for the pH gradient in isoelectric focusing). 
        There are only a small number of chemicals which can satisfy these criteria, 
        along with other important requirements such as the minimising of ionic 
        strength (a low ionic strength allows high voltages to be applied during 
        isoelectric focusing. This allows for a faster, more efficient focusing 
        step). Comprehensive details of solubilization methods can be found elsewhere. 
        
      <p><strong><a name="chaotropic" id="chaotropic" class="body"></a>Chaotropic agents</strong></p>
      <p>Chaotropic agents disrupt hydrogen bonds. This disruption occurs both 
        in the proteins and the water used to make the solubilizing buffer. Chaotropic 
        agents prevent unwanted aggregation and formation of secondary structure 
        which can alter protein mobility.</p>
      <p><strong><a name="detergents" id="detergents" class="body"></a>Detergents</strong></p>
      <p>These disrupt hydrophobic interactions between species, as well as promoting 
        solubility. Detergents must be non-ionic or zwitterionic to prevent them 
        migrating during the isoelectric focusing step.</p>
      <p><strong><a name="reducing" id="reducing" class="body"></a>Reducing agents</strong></p>
      <p>These disrupt disulfide bonds between cysteine residues. This allows 
        analysis of single subunits of protein.</p>

      <p><strong><a name="carrier" id="carrier" class="body"></a>Carrier Ampholytes</strong></p>
      <p>Some proteins tend to precipitate at their isoelectric point. To prevent 
        this one may add salt to the protein solution. However as soon as one 
        performs isoelectric focusing the salt will migrate away from protein 
        promoting precipitation. To solve this problem carrier ampholytes are 
        often included in the buffer.</p>
      <p><strong>Removal of nucleic acid</strong></p>
      <p>The presence of nucleic acids, especially DNA, interferes with isoelectric 
        focusing of proteins. Under denaturing conditions DNA complexes are dissociated 
        and markedly increase the viscosity of the solution. This inhibits entry 
        of the protein to the gel matrix and slows their movement during focusing. 
        Nucleic acids can be removed by enzymatic digestion.</p>
      <p><strong>Keratin</strong></p>
      <p>Careful handling is important to mimimise contamination from hair and 
        skin.</p>
