<ul>The primary structure of a protein is the linear sequence of 
amino acids connected in a series of peptide bonds.  This picture 
of peptide bonds was obtained from the WWW at 
<a href="http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/GenWeb/Molecular/Bioinformatics/Unit_4/Lab_4-1/lab_4-1.htm">

The primary structure is sometimes symbolized by a using the 
3 - or 1 - letter abbreviations for the amino acids.  For example, 
a short segment of the enzyme chymotrypsin has the following 
primary structure, represented first by full amino acid names, then by 
3 -letter abbreviations and finally by 1-letter abbreviations</p>

<h3>Valine - Threonine - Alanine - Alanine - Histidine - Cysteine - Glycine</h3>
<h3>VAL - THR - ALA - ALA - HIS - CYS – GLY </h3>
<h3>V - T - A - A - H - C - G </h3>
</center>

Proteins are much more than linear polymers.  The side chains on the 
individual <a href="Amino_Acids.htm">amino acids</a> enable them to 
form salt bridges (electrostatic interactions), hydrogen bonds, and 
hydrophobic interactions.  Secondary structure refers to hydrogen 
bonding patterns between amino acids that are close to each other 
in the primary sequence.  The alpha helix is a coiled structure in 
which hydrogen bonds form between the amide nitrogen of one amino 
acid and the carbonyl oxygen of the amino acid four residues away.  
Lysozyme (PDB file pdb1l48.ent) contains several alpha helices. You 
can see them using <a href="Protein_molecules.html">Chime</a>.
<p>
The beta sheet is a more extended secondary structure with hydrogen 
bonds between amide nitrogens and carbonyl oxygens on polypeptide 
chains that run either parallel or anti-parallel.  Chymotrypsin 
(PDB file pdb8gch.ent) contains a lot of beta sheet.

Tertiary structure refers to longer range interactions in the 
polypeptide structure, including hydrogen bonds and disulfide 
bridges between cysteine side chains that are adjacent in the 
three dimensional structure of the protein.

Many proteins consist of multiple subunits (separate polypeptide 
chains) that are held together by non-covalent forces.  This 
collection of non-covalent forces between subunits is called 
quaternary structure.  For example, horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase 
consists of two identical subunits that are held together by 
non-covalent forces.
