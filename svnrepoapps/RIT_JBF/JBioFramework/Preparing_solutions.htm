All the solutions used in this simulation consist of a 
<A href="Buffers.html">buffer</A> and salt (sodium chloride) in water.  
In practice, it is often desirable to include other additives to the 
mobile phase for protein separations, such as bacteriostatic agents.</p>
<p>

In preparing the mobile phase, the buffering agent is used at a 
concentration of 20 - 100 mM (0.02 - 0.10 M) and the pH is adjusted, 
usually with concentrated acid or base.  The buffer is selected so 
that the target pH of the mobile phase is close to the pK<sub>A</sub> 
for the buffer.  It is also possible to mix a buffer at a given pH by 
mixing the proper ratio of the acid and base forms of a weak acid or 
base (see <A href="Buffers.html">Buffers</A>).</p>
<p>
In ion exchange chromatography the binding and elution of protein is 
controlled by pH (which controls the charge on the protein and the 
stationary phase) and the salt concentrations.  
A bound protein can be released from the stationary phase by changing the 
pH of the mobile phase, or by increasing its salt concentration.</p>
